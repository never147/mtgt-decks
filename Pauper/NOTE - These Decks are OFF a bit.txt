Xmage isn't as perfect as MTGO, as far as determining which cards are legal for pauper, 
which cards are technically legal as commons/uncommons, and in some cases, the cards aren't even available. 

Keep that in mind, and justbe careful when importing netdeck Pauper decks.
I've replaced many non-existant XMAGE Pauper cards with others just to get a full 75.

Examples:
Standard Bearer doesn't seem to exist.
Oubliette isn't programmed either.
Prismatic Strands is not present.
Among those, plenty more white staple pauper cards.

Some of the cards, like Rancor, Chainer's Edict, Pyroblast & Hydroblast
have common and uncommon versions.

Make sure you have the COMMON version if you're making decks yourself.
Or, if you're importing netdecks, XMAGE doesn't always grab a COMMON version, so you need to make sure each individual card is in fact a common before trying to play in the queue with it.
