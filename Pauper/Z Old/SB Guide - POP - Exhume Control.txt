Pauper Gauntlet Season 3 entry.

Original deck by David Shaffer. Read his deck tech for in-depth info.

Changes: I tried a lot of changes, none of them proved to be clear improvements. As discussed with Dan, we are trying Devastators for the sake of trampling. They look better on the late game while the Crushers are better Exhume targets early.
