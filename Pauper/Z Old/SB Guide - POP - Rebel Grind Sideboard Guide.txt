General sideboarding:
Journey to Nowhere for extra removal against creatures you need to have off the battlefield. Bound in Silence for the matches were Pacifism is acceptable.

Suture Priest is brought in against the bouncy-house and token swarm decks. Familiar, Delver, White Tokens, Midnight Presence.

Kor Sanctifiers against decks with important Artifacts and Enchantments.

Nightwing or Thermal Glider against Black or Red decks respectively.

Prismatic Strands can be brought in against Red sweepers, Evincar's Justice, and aggro/combo like Eye Candy, Affinity, and Stompy.

Zealot il-Vec against decks with lots of X/1's, e.g. Delver

Relic of Progenitus against any deck abusing the graveyard. 

Cards to look at removing are Icatian Javileneers when there are no targets. Aven Riftwatcher against longer grinding match ups. And Bound in Silence when they can deal with it easily.
